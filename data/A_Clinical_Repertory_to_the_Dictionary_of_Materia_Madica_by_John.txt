PREFACE

—~oo——

I must ask my readers to do me the favour to give particular attention
to the prefaces to this work—not only to this, the general preface, but
also to the introductory notes to each separate division ; for, though
the uses of each division are fairly obvious, and the arrangements
simple, the RerzErory is capable of subserving other uses besides the
obvious ones, and these I shall endeavour to point out. That prince
of Repertory-makers, Von Boonninghausen, desoribed his well-known
“‘ Pocket Book’ as being intended for use at the bedside “and in the
study of the materia medica.’’ I may in the same way describe my
Repertory as being designed ‘for use in the study of the materia
medica” no less than as an instrument for finding out the indicated
remedies. Homeopathic practice consists in knowledge of materia
medica and knowledge how to use it. This demands unlimited
patience and application in the study of drug comparisons. My
Repertory will enable the practitioner to compare any remedy with
any similar remedy in five different points, all of great importance in
practice.

In my Dictionary of Practical Materta Medica every remedy is
described from a number of different points of view. The clinical point
of view is one of these, and under the heading ‘“‘ Curnicau”’ I have pre-
fixed to each remedy a list of the affections in which it has been found
most frequently indicated in practice. In compiling these clinical lists I
had in view tlie project of preparing, later on, an Index of theseheadings
to enable the reader to find at a glance all the remedies which have been
accredited with the cure or alleviation of any given state. The CuisicaL
Repzrrory herewith presented constitutes this Index.

Whilst the preparation of this work was in progress it occurred
to me that it would greatly extend the usefulness of the CrmicaL
Rerzerory if I were to add one or two other indices at the same time.

One of the sections under which I have described remedies in the
. Dictionary is headed ‘“‘Causartion.’’ This tells how remedies are related

to conditions due to definite Causes. I have therefore added an
vii .



--- Page 5 ---
Vill PREFACE

alphabetical list of Causs, under any one of which will be found
named all the drugs which have been observed to be curative in
conditions produced by it.

Another index deals with Temprraments. Acute observers, from
the time of Hahnemann onwards, have noticed that some remedies
act well on some types of persons and not at all so well on others.
The respective types of Nux vomica and Pulsatilla are well known;
-but many other remedies have preferences more or less well marked for
particular temperaments. These are mentioned in the Dictionary
under the heading ‘‘ CHARACTERISTIOS "’ as the types or constitutions the
particular remedy is specially ‘suited to.” In the second and third
volumes I have put the words “ suited to’’ in italics so that they may
be more easily found. In the Repertory of Temperaments they will all
be found completely indexed. This, I think, is of no little importance,
since type of constitution is very often a determining factor in the
choice of a remedy. There are some patients whose constitutions
correspond so accurately to a particular medicinal type, that the
corresponding remedy will cure almost any indisposition they may
happen to have. But under “Surrep To” are included not tempera-
ments, persons, and constitutions only, but also complainis occurring
in persons of particular age and type; so that this section becomes in
& way a complement of the Clinical Repertory—the firat and most
important division of this work. The user of the Repertory, therefore,
who may not find the remedy he is in search of in the Clinical
Repertory, may possibly find it in the Repertory of Temperaments
under the heading of the complaint the patient is suffering from.

The last of the repertories included in this volume is a RePERTORY
or Rexarionssirs. This is twofold, and includes Clinical Relationships
and Natural Relationships. The Repertory of Natural Relationships
. shows at a glance the place in nature of any remedy in question—
mineral, vegetable, or animal—and how it stands in regard to its
closest congeners. For instance, if a reader wishes to find the nearest
botanical relations of any plant remedy he will be able to find them
without difficulty. In the Dictionary is given the natural order of each
plant. In the Repertory will be found an alphabetical list of all the
natural orders represented, and under each is given in alphabetical
order a list of all the plants of that order included in the materia medica.

But there is also given a list of the natural orders in their systematic
or evolutionary order; so that every order is here given in juxtaposition
with its allied orders. In this list I have prefixed a number to each
order; and in the alphabetical list I have given each order the same



--- Page 6 ---
PREFACE ix

number. Thus on consulting the alphabetical list, not only will all the
individual members of that order be found there, but the number attached
to the order will enable the reader to refer to the numerical list and
find in that the orders most nearly allied to it. On reference to these
orders in the alphabetical list, all the members of each will be found.

This is often of importance, since there is a strong therapeutic
likeness between members of the same botanical group. The chief
fanction of homaopathy, it is true, is to individualise. This must be
effected with the greatest possible completeness. But when once this
has been done—and to effect this was one of the main objects I kept
before me in compiling my Dictionary—grouping can be of the utmost
value in the study and use of the materia medica. The mistake some
homeopathic therapeutists have made has been in taking the grouping
first, and thinking that this might prove a short-cut to learning the
materia medica. It is nothing of the kind: it merely results in
muddling the materia medica unless each individual remedy has been
first of all depicted in full detail.

When this individualising of remedies has been mastered, the
grouping becomes of great importance in practice. Of this both
Dr. Burnett and Dr. Cooper made the most brilliant use. I need only
instance the working out of the Lobelias by Dr. Cooper, and of some
of the Conifers by Dr. Burnett. Those who wish to follow up the
successes of these great therapeutists will have a light to guide them
in my Repertory of Natural Relationships.

But, quite independently of all known natural relationshipe—I say
‘‘Imown relationships” because there is nothing in nature really
unrelated to anything else—medicines are inter-related in various ways
in point of therapeutic action. A knowledge of these relations is all-
important to those who aim at accurate prescribing. Take the antidotal
relation, for example. It is often as important to be able to arrest a
medicinal action as it is to start it. A prescriber who cannot antidote
a drug effect is like the driver of a motor who cannot put on the brake.
Hahnemann was always careful to observe and record the antidotes to
the remedies he proved, and later observers have largely added to his
observations. Some remedies have been observed to prepare the way
for other remedies; some to follow others well. Such remedies are
_ termed compatibles. Some spoil the effects of others, and such are

called incompatibles. When a remedy has done good and has ceased
to be indicated, the choice of the remedy to follow will be greatly assisted
by a knowledge of Cumucan Rexationsnirs. I have therefore given a
tabulated list of all the remedies in the materia medica with their
antidotes and other related remedies. In compiling this table I have


--- Page 7 ---
x PREFACE

made use of the excellent table published by Dr. Gibson Miller m the
Homeopathic World of September, 1902. It will be noticed that many
of the remedies have no related remedies placed to their credit. This
does not mean that such do not exist, but only that they have not been
observed and recorded. I have not on that account omitted them from
the list, and the vacant spaces will serve the purpose of providing a
place for their entry whenever they may be found.

It will therefore be seen that the CumicaL Rerestory is a olinical
repertory and much more besides. The practitioner who consults it will
not be tied down to a mere list of names of diseases: he will be able
to test his choice of a remedy from other points of view, and if further
information should be required, the Dictionary of Materia Medica, which
this Rergrrory is designed to make more accessible, will supply it.

A necessary preliminary to the compilation of a work of this nature
was to fix the abbreviation which should always represent each remedy
named. In making choice of these abbreviations I have followed largely
those selected by the compilers of the Cypher Repertory. The chief
object aimed at in the selection has been to choose a combination of
letters which shall at once suggest the remedy and not suggest any
other remedy. This, as a matter of course, is an ideal which cannot
always be attained, but to make identification as easy as possible I
have given two lists—first a list of remedies in alphabetical order with
the abbreviations appended to each, and next a list of abbreviations in
alphabetical order with the remedy it stands for appended. It will be
observed that I have followed the Cypher Repertory in using the letter
“x.” to signify “acid”; “Nt. x.” is “nitric acid’; ‘Fl. x.” “ fluoric
acid,’’ &c. Every time a medicine is mentioned it begins with a capital
letter. When a name has two parts the second part always begins with
a small letter, Thus, in the text, it will be impossible to mistake where
the name of one remedy ends and the other begins.

It will be gathered from the above that the CrinioaL REPERTORY is
intended to serve a purpose of its own. It is given to the world as
complete in itself within the range of its aims. A Symptom-Repertory
to the Dictionary is a very different matter and a much larger under-
” taking. But I do not despair of seeing that work accomplished one
day. Some little progress has, in fact, already been made towards the
carrying out of this project.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CLINICAL
REPERTORY

Prenaps the best way for me to introduce the Cumican Raprrrory to
my readers will be to quote from the Dsctionary of Materia Medica
that part of the Preface which describes the portion here repertorised.
Writing of the section “Clinical” with which each remedy is introduced
in that work, I said :—

“¢ Oumvrca..’,

“Next, under the head Cummtcat, I have given an alphabetical list of the diseases
in relation to which the remedy has manifested or seems likely to manifest some
curative power. This list is of no independent authority, many of the items being
merely suggestions of my own. It is not to be regarded either as inclusive or
exclusive, but rather as suggestive. But the list serves further purposes; and first, it
enables me to save space. If I were to describe the sphere of a remedy in each of the
diseases in which it has been used, I should be obliged to repeat the same indications
many times over in alightly varied form. The main indications of a remedy are the
same in any disease, and the fine indications will be found on referring to the headings
under which they ocour in the Schema. Farther, the list enables me to relate the
Dictionary to the Prescriber. A number of the names of diseases in the list will be
found printed in italics. This does not mean that the medicine is more indicated in
these disesses than in the others; it is merely to indicate that under that particular
heading the drug will be found mentioned in the Prescriber, and that there its special
indications are given and compared with those of other remedies. For example,
under Arropmrum is the following list: ‘Blepharospasm. Convulsions. Enuresis,
Epilepsy. Eyes, affections of. Gastric Ulcer. Locomotor ataxy. Mania. Neuralgia.
Pancreatitis. Spinal irritation. Tetanus. Vision, disorders of.’ On referring to the
Prescriber, under Gastric Utcer and Pancrearrris, Atropinum will be found
mentioned along with other remedies. Finally, the lists will afford a convenient basis
for compiling a Clinical Index.”

The CirtcaL Repertory here presented is the work promised in
the last sentence of the above-quoted passage.

It will be noted that the Dictionary was linked to the Presorsber in
the Clinical section of the former. That link is preserved in the
CimicaL Rergretory. But instead of the names of diseases being
italicised, as in the Clinical headings, the names of the remedies are

81


--- Page 40 ---
32 "A CLINICAL REPERTORY

italicised in the CuinicaL Repertory. In the example quoted above
the words “ Gastric Ulcer” and ‘“‘ Pancreatitis” were printed in italics to
show that Atropinwm under which they occur would be found mentioned
under these headings in the Preseriber and its indications compared
with those of other remedies. In the Cumican RepPertory, under the
heading “Gastric ULczr” and “ Pancreatitis,” among the remedies
given ‘ Atro.” appears in italics. This indicates that under the same
headings it is given in the Presoriber. Under Locomotor Ataxy
“ Atro.” appears but not in italics. This implies that it is not given
in the Prescrsber under that heading.

The edition of the Prescriber to which reference is made in this
work is the sixth, which I prepared in the interval between the
appearance of the first and second volumes of the Dictionary. In it
will be found an Introductory chapter on ‘The Place of a Clinical
Repertory in Hommopathic Practice.” Having gone fully into this
subject there I need say little about it in this connection. The chief
problem of scientific therapeutics consists in the discovering of indica-
tions for remedies. All ways of finding indications are open to
practitioners, and the clinical avenue is one of them. This is not the
method which Hahnemann rightly condemned, and which is still the
prevailing one in old-school therapeutics, that, namely, of seeking for
remedies for diseases in the abstract. One result of this last method is.
that certain diseases come to have certain remedies assigned to them,
and all patients who are found to be suffering from any given disease
must be dosed with one of the remedies credited to it. Hahnemann
delivered all who have accepted his scientific method from the thraldom
of this purely academic, artificial practice. He fitly described it as
“treating the names of diseases with the names of therapeutic actions.”

There will not, I think, be any likelihood of readers lapsing into
this kind of practice.through the use of my CrinicaL REPERTORY.
The lists of remedies are in no way put forth as complete lists. In
homwopathy any remedy may be required in any case of any disease.
The occurrence of the name of any remedy under the heading of any
disease shows that in its action it has a general correspondence with
the most marked features of cases of that disease. This gives a
legitimate point of comparison for o start, at any rate, in the work of
selection.

It will frequently happen that the prescriber will have in mind a
number of remedies which more or less closely correspond to a given
case, and when he consults the Cxuinican Rersrrory this knowledge



--- Page 41 ---
A CLINICAL REPERTORY 33

will enable him at once to pick out of the list there presented the most
similar remedy to his case. Should he still be uncertain, if the
Prescriber does not help him out of his difficulty, he. will still have the
Dictionary to appeal to, in which each of the remedies named in the
Berrrrory will be found described individually in detail.

Further, if there is any point of Causation in the case, or any
striking type of Temperament, this work may itself provide the deter-
mining factor without the prescriber having to go further afield.

The use of the nosological correspondence is, as I have said,
one method by means of which « similar, if not the most similar,
remedy may be discovered. Another method is by ascertaining the
similarity of Spectfictty of Seat. Some drugs have a predominant
affinity for certain organs, and these drugs will often relieve a
great variety of affections seated in, or arising from diseases of these
particular organs. In compiling the Cumucau part of my Dictionary
I kept this in view. Many general headings such as “‘ Liver, dis-
eases of,” “Spleen, affections of,'’ will be found there; and they will
also'be found in the CurntcaL REPERTORY. The lists of remedies given
under these headings will show the drugs which have been observed to
hit these organs hardest, and will thereby give a very important point
for comparison. The work of Paracelsus and his disciple Rademacher
deals largely in Specifics based on this homoopathicity of organ-
affinity. The greatest modern exponent of this practice is the late
Dr. Compton Burnett, who has brought once more to light vast
therapeutic treasures which had been allowed to lie forgotten in the
works of these great masters. Those who understand the value of
such indications will find much to assist them in the Cxinican
REPERTORY.

REPERTORY OF CAUSATION
NOTE.

Atmost all remedies have relations of some kind to the various
accidents and conditions of ordinary life. Their symptoms are made
worse or better by heat or cold, rest or motion, by night or by day, or
other circumstances or conditions. Many remedies are related to the
effects of certain conditions. This is not just the same thing as &-
vation, though allied to it and sometimes identical with it. For
instance, Arnica removes morbid conditions (apart, of course, from
surgical injuries such as broken bones) caused by falls; Ruta relieves
the effects of bruised bones. It is not correct in either case to describe
these as aggravations, and therefore I thought well to arrange such
relationships under a separate heading in the Dictionary. These I have
now indexed, and repertorised, in the subjoined list.

Although Causation and Aggravation are not the same, they are
closely allied. Rhus is related to the effects of damp weather, and
appears in the list of remedies having this Causation; but it also has
its symptoms, when not caused by damp, aggravated in a supreme
degree by conditions of damp. Therefore the prescriber who uses this
list of CAUSES as a rough list of Aggravations also will not go far wrong,
and may find no little belp from it in some of his cases.

The names of a few remedies have been added which do not occur
in the Dictionary of Materia Medica. These, for the most part, I have
enclosed in brackets. When a cause is associated with any particular
effect, that effect is placed in brackets and precedes the name of the
remedy which corresponds to it. For instance, ‘‘ Washing clothes ”’
causes ill effects to which certain remedies correspond. Phosphorus
corresponds to headache resulting from washing clothes. in the
list of remedies this fact is marked thus: ‘‘ (headache) Pho.”” When,
in a list of remedies, one of them has a qualifying word or phrase thus
prefixed to it, the qualification must be understood to apply to that
remedy only, and not to those which follow.

NOTE.

Tas section of the Repertory gives in tabular form the chief clinical
relations of all remedies of the Materia Medica so far as they have been
noted. They are included under the following headings: ‘“ Comple-
mentary Remedies,” “Remedy Follows Well,” ‘“‘ Remedy is Followed
Well by,” ‘Compatible Remedies,” ‘ Incompatible Remedies,”
‘‘Remedy Antidotes,” ‘Remedy is Antidoted by.” There is also
added the duration of action of remedies so far as these have been
noted.

The term ‘“‘ compatible” is a generic term, and includes all the reme-
dies of the first three columns—+.c., the “complementary” remedies,
those which the remedy “ follows well,” and those which it is ‘followed
well by ”—but the column “Compatible Remedies ”’ has been included
because some remedies have been noted as compatible with others,
without further qualification.

Many remedies have not yet had their clinical relationships noted.
But I have not excluded them on this account; and spaces are thus
provided for the insertion of their related remedies when found later
on in practice,

REPERTORY
OF
NATURAL RELATIONSHIPS
NOTE. )

THe Homeopathic Materia Medica consists potentially, we may
say, of anything and everything that may be found in the universe.
Man himself epitomises the universe, and nothing in the universe can
therefore be said to be unrelated to him. It is his business to find out
the indications for the uses of the substances at his command, and the
methods in which they are to be prepared and applied. Some of them
he has discovered, and the substances thus rescued from the un-
known constitute the Homeopathic Materia Medica as it is at present
developed. .

The following lists will show remedies belonging to the different
kingdoms of nature arranged in the order of their natural kinship.
Readers will be able to discover how far natural relationship and
clinical relationship correspond so far as the Homosopathic Materia
Medica at present extends. The lists will enable readers to find how
almost any given remedy in the Materia Medica is related to any other
remedy in nature. The lists comprise“) Metala or Elements ;
6 nee Vegetable Kingdom ; (8) The Animal Kingdom; (4) Sarcodes ;

1, Merats on ELEMENTS.

An alphabetical list of the elements represented is given, each with .
its symbol and atomic weight. Prefixed to each name is a number.
This number shows its position in the succeeding list, which gives the
elements in the order of thetr atomic weights. In addition to this
distinguishing number in the second list is affixed the letter “G” and
a Roman numeral. This refers to a third list—a list of the Men-
deléeffian Groups; and the numeral shows in which of these groups any
given element is to be found.

2. VearTaBLeE Kinepom,

There are two lists given in this section—a list of natural orders in
alphabetical order, and a list of natural orders in systematic or evolu-
tionary order. In the first, or alphabetical list, under the name of each

895


--- Page 336 ---
326 NATURAL RELATIONSHIPS

order, all the remedies of the order are given, also alphabetically. The
alphabetical list is distinguished by numbers which correspond with the
numbers of the systematic list, so that the place of any remedy in each
list can at once be found.

Suppose, for example, that it were desired to find out all the
relations of Belladonna in the Materia Medica. On consulting the
Dictionary it would be found that Belladonna belongs to the Solanaceae.
Looking up Solanacee in the alphabetical list, we find 20 other reme-
dies belonging to the same order. Affixed to the name of the order
we find the number “68.” Turning to the systematic list, we find
Solanaceae bracketed with Convolvulacee (67), Boraginacee (66), and
Hydrophyllacea (65), and followed by Scrophulariacea (69), ke.
Under each of these orders, in the alphabetical list, all their members
will be found. Thus the relation of Belladonna to any or all of them
may be traced.

8. AnmmaL Kinepom.

Of the animal kingdom a similar arrangement has been adopted—an
alphabethical list distinguished by numbers corresponding to numbers
in the succeeding systematic list. In arranging the latter I have been
governed mainly by Francis P. Pascoe’s ‘“ Zoological Classification.”

the Dictionary, and the authorities on which it has relied, no very
definite distinction between ‘Orders’ and “Families” has been
observed in describing the place or the various animals; bat I do not
think this will occasion any difficulty in tracing any animal remedy
and its natural relations.

4. SARCODES.

I have found the term “Sarcodes”’ useful for designating the
remedies prepared from healthy animal tissues and organs. They are
“ flesh” remedies, and edpt is Greek for “flesh.” These are remedies
of very great importance, and I have given a list of them, together with
a supplementary list of remedies derived from altered tissues and
sooretions, as Urea and Uric acid from Urine, Thyro-iodin from Thyroid
8 » XC.

5. Nosopes

Nosodes are remedies derived from morbid tissues and secretions
containing the specific virus of diseases. A list of these remedies, the
importance of which is becoming daily more recognised, concludes
this section.

A DICTIONARY OF PRACTICAL MATERIA

MEDICA. In three Volumes. Super royal 8vo, pp. 2564.
Price: Buckram, £3 3s. net; or Half Morocco, £3 12s. 6d.

dollars. Duty and mailage extra.

‘This is the work to which the Clinical Repertory is an Index.
The two works are complementary to each other, although they may
be used independently. The Dictionary of Practical Materia
Medica covers the field of homeopathic materia medica more
completely than any other work which has yet appeared. The
arrangement is original and is especially designed for rapid accessibility
and practical use. The accessibility of the Dictionary is immensely
increased by the Clinical Repertory now issued.

«This great work of Dr. Clarke’s might fittingly crown the life labours of half-a-
dozen ordinary authors, The title ‘Dictionary’ hardly describes it to American
minds; it is rather an Encyclopedia of the homoopathio materia medica. There is
no drug, either of major or minor importance, from the polychrests down to drugs
presenting but one symptom of value, which we have not been able to find in this
work. . . . The book is printed on an excellent unglazed paper, a delight to eyes
worn with much reading; the type is satisfying, and the binding suited to a book
of such value. Add it to your library. It will serve as a firm foundation for a life's .
work in the sphere of medicine.”—Chironian.

THE NEW THERAPEUTICS. | Sixth Radition.
Feap. 8vo, pp. 300. Cloth, 4s.; Interleaved, 5s. ; full-leather

The Prescriber is a pocket repertory of homcopathio practice.
_ It has met with great favour on both sides of the Atlantic and has
passed through five large editions. The present, sixth edition (1900),
was prepared after the first volume of the Dictionary of Practical
Materia Medica had been completed. It contains the author's latest
additions and revisions. The Prescriber has a practical connection
with both the Clinical Repertory and the Dictionary of Materia

Medica. The edition of the Prescriber referred to in these works is
the present sixth edition.

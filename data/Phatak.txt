PREFACE
To the First Edition

Prescribing in Homoeopathy is both Science and Art. But it is
a difficult Art. Good case taking, sound knowledge of Materia
Medica and skilful use of the reference books are the three
prerequisites.

This repertory is intended to serve as a handy and useful
reference book. It is an attempt to lessen the difficulties of
the prescriber. No originality can be claimed in a book of this
type, except that of presentation. There are advantages and
disadvantages in the traditional type of repertory. The author
feels that the present arrangement will minimize the
disadvantages. Remedies for a particular rubric are reduced
to minimum possible by a careful selection. No drug is given
unless the author has used it in his own practice or unless
there is strong justification provided for it, by authorities like
Dr. Boger, Dr. Kent, Dr. -Clark’s Dictionary etc.

A concise repertory cannot take the place of exhaustive
repertories of Kent, Boeninghausen and others. It is aimed
at reducing the burden of the prescriber, in every sense of
the word.

In this repertory, the headings mentals, generals,
modalities, organs, and their sub-parts are all arranged
according to their alphabetical order. All the physiological and

Plan of the pathological conditions such as appetite,
Book & How aversions, desires, nausea, vomiting,
to Use it thirst, fever, pulse etc. are also included
in alphabetical order. Cross references are

given wherever necessary. In such arrangement there will
be no difficulty in finding the appropriate rubrics. In each such

v


--- Page 8 ---
rubric all important symptoms, their concomitants and their
modalities are given. But the prescriber should not entirely
depend on the particulars, for finding out the correct remedy.
If he cannot find the correct remedy, according to the totality
of symptoms, under the particular organ or sub-part of it, so
much the better, otherwise he has to find the remedy
considering the general conditions and general modalities.
For all the general modalities, the words Agg. and Amel. are
printed AGG. and AMEL. For the modalities under particular
rubric only, there should be no difficulty in finding out as to
which modality is general and which is particular. For example
“Eyes closing Agg”. Though this modality is given under eyes,
it modifies the general symptoms as well as those of the eyes.

Dr. Boger has a remarkable knack of coining a general
rubric from some particular symptom. (Those who have used
his Synoptic Key must have noticed it). For example, take
the rubric ‘Awkwardness’. This symptom is given by Dr. Kent
in his repertory under, ‘Extremities’. There it shows that the
patient either drops things from his hands or walks stumbling.
But when Dr. Boger made it a general rubric, it means that
the patient’s mental and/or physical behaviour may be
awkward. All such headings coined by Dr. Boger are included
in this repertory. Not only that but the author himself has
coined a few new headings from his own experience. For
example the rubric “unsteady sensation”. Once a patient
consulted the author for this sensation. This patient, whenever
he used to stand for more than a few minutes, used to feel
unsteady, not giddy, but as if he was not standing firmly on
the ground. The author found for him the remedy from those
given under unsteady gait.

Every homeopathic practitioner is Aware that modalities
and concomitants are the most important factors for finding a
correct remedy. The author has garnered all useful modalities
from different standard repertories and has included those in
this book. The modality “Holding the breath Amel”, is given

vi


--- Page 9 ---
only by Dr. Boenninghausen in his Therapeutic Pocket Book.
This modality gave the author, once an opportunity to cure
remarkably an ulcer on the dorsum of the foot due to Thrombo-
angitis obliterans.

The repertories are compiled for finding out as far as
possible a correct remedy by referring to the various symptoms
given under various organs; along with the circumstances,
conditions and timing which modify them. In order to arrive
at the suitable remedy, the remedies given under a particular
symptom are graded according to their importance. The
prescriber, however, should bear in mind that every remedy—
high grade or low grade becomes equally important when it
is connected with peculiar concomitant or with and unusual
condition or circumstance. Repertorization does not mean
mechanical repertorization. Totality-of Symptoms does
not mean numerical totality, but qualitative totality. One
peculiar concomitant or an unusual condition may determine
the totality of the case.

Patients do not always tell their symptoms according to
the rubric used in the repertory.-Nor do they give all the
information required by the prescriber. The prescriber has to
find much of the information regarding modalities and
concomitants by appropriate questioning and confirm it by
cross-questioning. After this, the prescriber with his logical
mind has to sift, evaluate and interpret the meaning of the
symptom or symptoms correctly, to enable him to refer to the
appropriate rubric in the repertory. All the modalities in a
case are not equally important. The modality regarding the
position or posture of a patient may sometimes be more
valuable. If a patient says that he feels better only when he
assumes some strange position, this condition should be
considered first. This modality is not given in any standard
repertory, though some positions in sleep are given. But Dr.
Boger with his remarkable knowledge of behaviour of drugs
has coined a heading, “Attitudes bizarre” given under
generalities. The meaning is obvious. The patient’s disposition

Vil


--- Page 10 ---
whether mental or physical is bizarre, i.e. strange or unusual.
Again some modality may be common, but when associated,
with the diseased condition, with which it has absolutely no
connection, becomes uncommon or unusual. Once the author
was consulted by a patient who was suffering from what is
known as peripheral neuritis. He was not suffering from
diabetes, nor were there any untoward incidents preceding
that condition. The patient felt pain in both the legs, below
the knees. The pain was better by moving the legs, while
walking and by hard pressure. But the patient told the author
that when he belched or passed flatus, he felt much relief. If
the prescriber will try to find a remedy for this group of
symptoms from any other repertory, he is probably liable to
miss the mark. But Dr. Boger has given the modality “Passing
flatus up and down, Amel” under the rubric “Flatulence”.
The author has elevated the rank of this particular to the
general rubric.

The aversions, desires, mental attitudes, causation, have
their own place in the selection of the remedy, when they are
very marked. Causations will be found under Agg’s either
general or particular. Mental attitudes will be found under
mental conditions. Sometimes the appearance of symptoms
on one side, or going upwards or downwards etc., give a right
clue to the selection of remedy, when they are very marked.
All these conditions are given under ‘Directions’ of symptoms.
The prescriber should be alert; he should look everywhere
to arrive at the correct remedy.

Everything cannot be explained in the preface. But the
author hopes, that the few instances given about will enable
the prescriber to understand what to look, where to look, and
how to look. As said in the beginning, prescribing in
homoeopathy is an Art. And one can only achieve sort of
proficiency in this Art by constant and diligent study of the
remedies given in various standard materia medica, with
reference to their place value given in the repertory.

Vill

The author conceived the idea of preparing and arranging
the repertory in one alphabetical order when he used to
discuss the uses of various repertories with the doctors who

came to him for guidance in the study of
Story of
This Book Homoeopathy. he repertory had also to be
a concise and handy one. Though this idea
took root, the author on account of his indifferent health was
reluctant to undertake this task. But his friend Mr. S. L.
Kapadi, who knew about the idea, unexpectedly came to his
help. One day he came to the author will a skeletal copy of
this work and asked the author to fill up the gaps, check and
recheck it. This skeleton work was prepared by Mr. Kapadi
from author’s rough draft, notes etc. of Marathi repertory.
The author was surprised. This was more than what was
expected from a layman.

The author had to consent. He arranged the work
properly, rewrote it and made many additions: Dr. (Miss)
Homai A. Merchant who used to come to the author for
guidance in the study of Homoeopathy saw this hand-written
copy. She herself very kindly offered to type it. The typed
copy was lying with the author for nearly ten years. During
this interval, many useful additions were made. But on
account of various reasons, the author did not consider getting
it printed. Mr. Kapadi induced my son to get it printed. When
it was decided to publish it, my son approached Mr. D. P.
Datay, who promised all help and undertook the composing
work. The author had no choice left.

Dr. (Miss) Merchant again came to the rescue. When
requested, very willingly she typed the whole work again for
the press and made some valuable suggestions.

No work is ever complete. But it can be rightly claimed
that considering the object of writing a compact, handy
repertory useful for prompt reference, no effort was spared
to make this work as complete as possible.


--- Page 12 ---
Thanks are due to Dr. (Miss) Merchant of her neat typing.

My son Dr. D. S. Phatak did the preliminary spadework. He

went through all the cross references, looked

Thanks _ the final proof carefully and deserves all
giving praise.

The author does not know how to thank Mr. Kapadi,
without whose preliminary help and persistence later, the
book may not have seen the light of the day. Prescribers who
find this book useful owe a great deal to this interest in it.

Finally the author is gratefully indebted to all those
masters of Homoeopathy from whose works he has drawn
freely to make this book as useful as possible.

The author is well aware of the mistakes which have
crept in, inspite of careful proof reading. Lines under some
rubrics are misplaced while printing. The prescriber is
requested to correct the book as per errata and refer to the
list of abbreviations when necessary.

PREFACE
To The Second Edition

While compiling a Materia Medica as a companion volume to
my repertory, I have had to go through different materia
medicas written by various authors like Hering, Clarke, Boger,
Boericke, Kent and many others.

While doing this I found many new clinical and
pathological symptoms. So I have taken this opportunity to
add these symptoms in this edition of my repertory. Very few
changes were found necessary while revising the book.

My repertory was well received’ not only in India, but
even abroad in America and England. The demand for it was
persistent and increasing, but if my colleague Dr. P. Sankaran
had not undertaken the responsibility of publishing it, the book
in this second edition would not have seen the light so soon.
Not only I thank him but users ofthis book must thank him
also for this.

My friend Dr. (Miss) Homai Merchant has been kind
enough to offer her services and type out the whole manuscript
without a single murmur. For this I am grateful to her.

No repertory, whether exhaustive or concise, is ever
complete. Yet, I hope this book will be more useful to
prescribers to find the correct remedy in most of their daily
routine cases. And if they know the techniques of Dr. Boger,
they will have occasion to refer to the exhaustive repertories
very rarely.

Lastly I must thank God for preserving me in spite of
my old age and poor health to see this edition published.

PREFACE
To The Third Edition

I am happy that after about 23 years this third edition is being
published. The total period for the revision was about seven
years.

The number of pages have increased partly because of
bigger type, still the book remains handy. New additions are
marked with ‘+’ mark.

B. Jain Publishers deserve my thanks for the publication.

PUBLISHERS NOTE
To The Fourth Edition

A Concise Repertory of Homoeopathic Medicines by Dr. S.R.
Phatak is an alphabetized re-working of Boger and
Boenninghausen. The book is very popular and that is the
reason that we keep on receiving a lot of suggestions for
improvement of the book. Dr. C. Jeevanandam is one such
intelligent reader who has been constantly advising us on
corrections and change in style of presentation to make the
next edition more user friendly. Impressed by his avid
interest in the book we requested him to Revise and Correct
the Third Edition. Dr. C. Jeevanandam is a great lover of
homoeopathy and has tremendous admiration for Dr. Phatak’s
Repertory and it was the same spirit that he went through
the book word by word to point out all the mistakes and design
the new user-friendly format. The DTP and Editing of the
Fourth Edition has been done under his able supervision. We
at B. Jain are very grateful for his~services which he did on
voluntary basis.

The Changes Made for the Current Fourth Edition are as
follows:

1. The text takes a new format, with distinctive style for
each level of symptoms. The symptoms go up to five
levels as the following illustration shows:

Levell MMAMMAE: Bell, Bry: Carb-an; Cham; Con;
Hyds; Iod; Lac-c; Merc; Oci-c; Pho; Phyt; Sabal;
Sil; Urt.

Level2 Right: Ign; Kali-bi; Phel; SIL.

Level 3 e Below: Carb-an; Caust; Chel; CIMI; Grap;
Laur; Lil-t; Merc-i-r; Pho; Sul; Ust.

¢ Jumping alive, as ift+: Croc.

- dysmenorrhoea, with: Caus.
- head, to: Glo.
- jumping: Croc.
- meals, after: Rum; Stro.
- menses
Level 5 at: Grap.

between: Ust.

2. An important change is that now with successive
levels, the symptoms of the previous level is fully
repeated. For instance, one fourth level symptom in
the above extract reads:

Mammage, left, pain, head to

In the original arrangement, only a few words from the
higher level should be considered in constructing the
symptom at a lower level. Sometimes the exact meaning of
the symptom was difficult to construe. For instance, in the
original version:

COUGH:
Walking, Fast Agg: Sep.

XIV


--- Page 17 ---
Amel: Canc-fl; Dros.

Could mean

Cough, amel by walking fast: Canc-fl; Dros.

This now appears as:

COUGH

Walking
e Amel: Canc-fl; Dros.
e Fast Agg: Sep.

In order to retain the natural language as far as possible, after
the head word in a symptom, the sequence of the rest of the
words have been rearranged, as far as possible.

Although the repertory is based on alphabetical arrangement,
for major organs, rubrics on locations are arranged first
followed by complaints and sensations. Among the locations,
the right side is followed by the left. Wherever this
arrangement was not followed, it has been corrected.

Similarly, in certain modalities pertaining to stools, menses,
etc., the order of appearance, viz., before, during and after, has
been consistently followed.

There are two types of alternating symptoms - (i) alternating

sides within the same organ/location, and (i) symptoms
alternating with other organs. The first category comes
under locations and the second under complaints. This has
been uniformly followed.

Additions made by Dr. D.S. Pathak have been placed at
appropriated places and duplications avoided. The additions
are indicated by placing ‘+’ after the symptoms. Addition of
remedies to the existing rubrics have also been indicated
similarly.

Gradations of remedies have been restored to those of the
original edition, wherever they differed.

confusion, a full list of abbreviation of remedies has been
provided.

The cross reference within the same first level rubric is
indicated by romans; where they refer to a different first
level rubric, they are indicated by CAPITALS.

Indication of general agg and amel in capitals and particular
agg and amel in romans has been consistently followed.

Each column begins with full details of the rubric. Where a
rubric is broken between two columns, the continuation on
the second column is indicated by the rubric head followed
by two dots.

The header indicates the beginning and ending first level
rubric word in each page.

In few cases, more than one abbreviation was found for the
same remedy. This has been corrected.

An ideal repertory for the beginners and for those who believe in artistic
prescribing. The simplest and handy repertory in an alphabetical order.
Remedies for a particular rubric are reduced to minimum possible by a
careful selection which makes drug selection easier, simpler and efficient.
This is a repertory, which the students can use for their first cases they wish
to prescribe for. In this repertory, the headings include Mentals, Generals,
Modalities, Organs and their sub-parts; all arranged in an alphabetical
order. Physiological and pathological conditions have also been included.
Cross references are given wherever necessary.

e Enlarged and improved version with additions from standard books
and repertories like Boericke, Kent, BTPB, Dr Clarke's dictionary etc.

e Inclusion of accurate clinical observations and experiences

e Contains pathological entities and rubrics even missed in the Kent's
repertory

e Generalization concept of Dr. Phatak has been highlighted. General
modalities have been mentioned as AGG. and AMEL., whereas
particular modalities have been distinguished as agg. and amel.

Dr. S.R. Phatak, a master prescriber in the field of homeopathy, has
contributed immensely to the homeopathic literature. His books are

Medica’ is very popular amongst the students and practitioners. His books
